    <h2 class="early">Early Life Career</h2>

    <p class="description1">Taylor Alison Swift was born on December 13, 1989, in Reading, Pennsylvania. Swift spent her
        early years on her family's Christmas tree farm in nearby Wyomissing. Her grandmother had been a professional
        opera singer, and Swift soon followed in her footsteps. By the age of 10, Swift was singing at a variety of
        local events, including fairs and contests. She sang "The Star-Spangled Banner" at a Philadelphia 76ers game at
        the age of 11, and began writing her own songs and learning guitar at 12 years old.

        To pursue her music career, Swift often visited Nashville, Tennessee, the country music capital. There she
        co-wrote songs, and tried to land a recording contract. Noting her dedication, Swift and her family moved to
        nearby Hendersonville, Tennessee, in an attempt to further Swift's career.</p>
